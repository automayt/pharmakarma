<div><li>A <b>smallsize market cap</b> asset carries substantial risk in both analysis limitations and volatility. Historical movement occurs within the nearest week of the predicted PDUFA data. However, PDUFA dates are not guaranteed and can oftentimes exhibit a wider swing than the 1 week period of interest for these assets.</div>
<div><li>A <b>largesize market cap</b> asset is very easy to research, but oftentimes carries too much inertia for hype to affect a change. Successful PDUFA dates have a significant change to move their value, but don't expect a large swing in preparation for the date.</div>
<div><li>A <b>midsize market cap</b> is large enough that it can usually be easily researched and is small to exhibit significant value changes based on anticipated PDUFA dates. A buy-in 2 weeks prior will regularly show gains. However, beware of other possibly negative features such as a history of CRLs.</div>
